To find the initial reference plan, you can choose one of the methods: northwest corner, minimum element, Vogel approximation, double preference. The optimal plan is found by the potential method. Everything is described in detail and step by step, and tables are also visually shown. At the end, the optimal plan is shown and a graph of the optimal solution is displayed. You can save the report in txt, docx, xlsx format.
